      "question": "Features of HDFS",
      "answer": " 1.HIGHLY FAULT-TOLERANT : Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. HDFS itself has a mechanism of highly fault-tolerant. Fot that we replicate data in multiple machines. A single data is not stored in a single machine, it is stored in the minimum of 3 machines.    2. HIGH THROUGHPUT : the quantity of raw material or information processed or communicated in a given period, especially by the computer. if we use useg 1 machine it takes 45mintes, if we take 10 machines it takes 4.5 minutes. Thiis is why it is hight throughtput. Yahoo uses 5000 of clusters to retrieve the data. throughtput is the amount of time it reads the data. It reads the data in paralle.     3. SUITABLE FOR APPLICATIONS WITH LARGE DATA SETS : Always makes the file size is larger    4. STREAMING ACCESS TO FILE SYSTEM DATA : Write Once and Read Many Times. You will not update the records again & again     5. CAN BUILD OUT OF COMMODITY HARDWARE :  It means without using highend servers it works fine. ",

      "question": "Spring Vs Struts",
      "answer": "Apache Struts 2 is an elegant and extensible framework that is used for creating enterprise-level Java web applications. It is designed to streamline the development cycle, starting from building to deployment and maintenance of the application. In Struts, the object that is taking care of a request and routes it for further processing is known as Action. On the other hand, Spring MVC is a part of a huge Spring framework stack containing other Spring modules. This means that it doesn’t allow developers to run it without Spring, but the developers can run the Spring Core without Spring MVC. The Spring MVC (Model View Controller) is designed around a DispatcherServlet, which dispatches the requests to handler with configurable handler mappings, view resolution and theme resolution.While the objects responsible for handling requests and routing for processing in Struts called an Action, the same object is referred as Controller in Spring Web MVC framework. This is one of the very first differences between Spring MVC and Struts2. Struts 2 Actions are initiated every time when a request is made, whereas in Spring MVC the Controllers are created only once, stored in memory and shared among all the requests. So, Spring Web MVC framework is far efficient to handle the requests than Struts 2.",
